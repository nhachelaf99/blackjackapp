# BlackJackApp

This is an app I made for my friends and I to solve any disagreement by sheer luck

It is build in JavaScript using core features like:

Arrays
Conditionals
DOM Manipulation
Math

This project is still under developement as I am still going to create a better graphic interface for it.
